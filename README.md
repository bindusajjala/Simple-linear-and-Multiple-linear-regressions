# Simple-linear-and-Multiple-linear-regressions
# 📊 SLR & MLR Prediction Web App 🚀

This project demonstrates the deployment of *Simple Linear Regression (SLR)* and *Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)* models using *Flask* and an interactive *HTML/CSS frontend*.  
Users can enter input values to get *instant predictions* along with *dynamic visualizations* that show how the models work.  
It bridges the gap between machine learning and web development, making predictive models more accessible.  
The project is lightweight, easy to use, and runs locally on any system with Python installed.

## 🔎 Project Overview

- *Simple Linear Regression (SLR):*  
  This model is trained to predict *Salary* based on a single independent variable: *Years of Experience*.  
  It fits a straight regression line to the data, which shows how salary increases with experience.  
  Users can input experience values and instantly see the predicted salary along with a graph.  
  The visualization makes it easier to understand how the model maps inputs to outputs.  

- *Multiple Linear Regression (MLR):*  
  This model predicts *Profit* using multiple independent variables like R&D, Admin, Marketing, and State.  
  It captures the combined influence of different factors, making predictions more realistic.  
  The state feature is encoded numerically, allowing categorical data to be included in the model.  
  This setup demonstrates how businesses can use ML to forecast outcomes from multiple features.
